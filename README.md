# AirTrafficRadar
A desktop application for real-time airport traffic monitoring featuring METAR data, live webcams and their live ATC radio, and ADSB-Exchange integration. 
Built with Python and PyQt6.
There is no real benefit of this app, i just wanted to create a more interesting "Panel" for using already existing services. Just for fun :) 

## Features
- Live METAR data display (http://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/)
- Airport webcam integration (youtube live streams)
- ADSB-Exchange radar view (https://globe.adsbexchange.com/) (works with PremiumAccount/Login aswell, then without ads)
- Configurable airport database (airport.json file)
- Dark mode interface (GUI matches ADSB-Exchange)

## Prerequisites
- **Python** 3.9.7 x64
- **VLC Media Player installed**
- I only tested it on windows 11 x64

## Disclaimer
This app was built mostly with AI as a fun project for a friend. Im only using publicly avaible data (see features) and combine them in one GUI.
Do whatever floats your boat with it ^^
